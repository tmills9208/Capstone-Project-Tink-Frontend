# CapstoneProject - The Frontend

Developed by Triad Development, who consists of myself; Tyler Mills, and my friends Graham White & Lynn Varga

We chose to make our own project for the Capstone, a gaming social platform where users could connect to the website, add their platforms and games, like Steam, ubisoft, Xbox One to name a few, and find users that have matching platforms and similarily played and liked games, so they can match with other people. The website was planned to be specificly designed so that users could meet new gamers, looking for games that they play.

I mostly developed, and was in charge of the front-end, save for a few features done by my friends. I learned quite a bit about creating and utilizing React's functional components and hooks, and learned to develop better project structure over the course of the semester. 
The project also utilizes libraries such as:
- Material-UI: Component library that utilizes Material Design principles
- Formik & Yup: Form handling and data validation.
- Redux: for simple state change and persistence

There was also a backend server codebase for the project but I didn't include it because I barely worked on it. I only needed to make calls to the server from the website.
